Producer: sending application
Consumer: receiving application
Queue: the object in rabbitmq that stores messages before they are sent
    to consumers. The message buffer. It is limited only by the rabbitmq
    server hosts memeory and disk space.
routing_key: A string that specifies a specific queue.
connection: A connection to a rabbitmq server
channel: a virtual connection to a rabbitmq server


Only producers need to specify an exchange, consumers can hook directly into queues.

acknowledgement: a message sent by the consumer to the broker to acknowledge that work was done
    successfully.

View unacknowledged messags: sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged

Message durability:
    marking queues and messages durable so rabbitmq will remember them if it restarts.
    Both consumers and producers need to mark a queue as durable.
    To mark a message as durable, set the properties.delivery_mode to 2

Fair dispatch
    setting the prefetch_count to 1 will guarentee that rabbitmq doesn't send more
    than one message to a consumer at a time
